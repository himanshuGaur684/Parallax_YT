He made 82 out off 53 balls.\n\nVirat Kohli treated his fans to one of the memorable innings in the history of T20 World Cup as made an unbeaten knock of 82 and led India to victory against Pakistan by four wickets.\n\nIn what turned out to be a thriller of a match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Kohli took up the responsibility of hitting the big ones at a time when India was in trouble chasing 160.
